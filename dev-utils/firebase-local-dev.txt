# Using Firebase Local Development Environment to Bypass CORS Issues

Setting up Firebase Hosting for local development can help avoid CORS issues by serving your app and accessing Firebase services from the same origin.

## Step 1: Install Firebase CLI
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

## Step 2: Login to Firebase
```
firebase login
```

## Step 3: Initialize Firebase in your project
```
firebase init
```
Select these options:
- Hosting (for configuring Firebase Hosting)
- Storage (for local emulation)
- Emulators (to run local development servers)

## Step 4: Configure firebase.json for your React app
Make sure your firebase.json looks similar to this:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": [
      "firebase.json",
      "**/.*",
      "**/node_modules/**"
    ],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  },
  "emulators": {
    "auth": {
      "port": 9099
    },
    "storage": {
      "port": 9199
    },
    "hosting": {
      "port": 5000
    },
    "ui": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Update your Firebase config to use emulators

In your src/firebase/config.js file, add this code:

```javascript
// Initialize Firebase
const app = initializeApp(configToUse);
const db = getFirestore(app);
const storage = getStorage(app);
const auth = getAuth(app);

// Connect to emulators in development environment
if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {
  // Use dynamic import to avoid build issues
  import('firebase/storage').then(({ connectStorageEmulator }) => {
    connectStorageEmulator(storage, 'localhost', 9199);
    console.log('Connected to Firebase Storage emulator');
  });
}
```

## Step 6: Build your React app
```
npm run build
```

## Step 7: Start the Firebase emulator suite
```
firebase emulators:start
```

This will:
1. Start the Storage emulator on localhost:9199
2. Start the Firebase Hosting emulator to serve your app
3. Open the Emulator UI dashboard

## Step 8: Access your app at http://localhost:5000

When you run your app this way, CORS issues are eliminated because:
1. Your app is served from the Firebase domain
2. Storage operations are intercepted by the local emulator
3. No cross-origin requests are being made

This is ideal for development without needing to configure CORS on your production bucket.
